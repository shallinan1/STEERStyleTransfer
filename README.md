# Getting Started

## Setting up the Environment
To set up the environment to run the code, make sure to have conda installed, then run

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Then, activate the environment:

```
conda activate style
```

## Downloading required resources

We need to download a few resources for STEER.

*  **Base Model**

    Download the GPT2-large paraphraser from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hB0lJt4MjuWbgdY7_I_2eISAoNmM6O9f); it is the folder named `paraphraser_gpt2_large`. Place this model in the following directory: `models/paraphraser_gpt2_large`. (TODO: upload this to huggingface)

* **CDS Synthetic Parallel Training Dataset** 

    Our filtered dataset is located on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hallisky/STEER-data-top-400k-combo/tree/main). However, since the huggingface `load_dataset` function has an issue, we must manually download `top400k_data_combo.jsonl`. Place the data in the following directory: `training_data_topk/top400k_data_combo.jsonl`.
  
### (Optional) Downloading resources for offline use

Though the STEER code will automatically download models as the code progresses, we can also pre-cache these values by downloading them first. Use the following code to download the other models used in the code:

```
python3 download_all_models.py
```

If you do this, make sure the `cache_dir` in `main.py` matches the `cache_dir` specified in `download_all_models.py`.

## Compute Requirements

## Training

To train our unified style model, we can run the following command:

```
# For a100, 200k
python3 main.py \
    --precomputed_dataset_dir hallisky/STEER-data-top-400k-combo \
    --n_extra_tokens 5 \
    --init_model models/paraphraser_gpt2_large \
    --ref_model models/paraphraser_gpt2_large \
    --temperature 1.0 \

    abstract = "While text style transfer has many applications across natural language processing, the core premise of transferring from a single source style is unrealistic in a real-world setting. In this work, we focus on arbitrary style transfer: rewriting a text from an arbitrary, unknown style to a target style. We propose STEER: Unified Style Transfer with Expert Reinforcement, a unified frame-work developed to overcome the challenge of limited parallel data for style transfer. STEER involves automatically generating a corpus of style-transfer pairs using a product of experts during decoding. The generated offline data is then used to pre-train an initial policy before switching to online, off-policy reinforcement learning for further improvements via fine-grained reward signals. STEER is unified and can transfer to multiple target styles from an arbitrary, unknown source style, making it particularly flexible and efficient. Experimental results on a challenging dataset with text from a diverse set of styles demonstrate state-of-the-art results compared to competitive baselines. Remarkably, STEER outperforms the 175B parameter instruction-tuned GPT-3 on overall style transfer quality, despite being 226 times smaller in size. We also show STEER is robust, maintaining its style transfer capabilities on out-of-domain data, and surpassing nearly all baselines across various styles. The success of our method highlights the potential of RL algorithms when augmented with controllable decoding to overcome the challenge of limited data supervision.",
